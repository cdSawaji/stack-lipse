	<div>
		<p>Swordfish provides local and remote server deployment of Swordfish features, that is, a Swordfish Service 
		Provider created within the Ecipse IDE Workbench can be deployed onto a remote Swordfish Runtime Server (OSGi enabled). 
		The client deployer functionality allows you to define the connection properties to a remote server via a the Eclipse IDE,and then
		add features to this newly defined remote server.</p>

		<p>These are the main tasks to be completed to deploy features onto a remote server.</p>

		<br /><ol>
			<li>Create plug-in projects</li>

			<li>Create feature plug-in development projects and asisgn plug-ins to them.</li>

			<li>Convert the feature plug-in development projects to faceted form and assign them to Swordfish Runtime</li>

			<li>Add a new Swordfish Server definition.</li>

			<li>Add the faceted feature projects to the the server and publish them.</li>

		</ol>

		<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> To avoid dependency problems, transfer all features that may contain dependent plug-ins in a single step.</div>

		<p>The client side deployer can deploy any set of plug-ins that are represented as plug-in projects in the Eclipse IDE. 
		Plug-ins that are to be deployed must be assigned to features. The assignment does not need to be exclusive. This means that 
		some plug-ins can be contained within multiple features. Multiple features may be deployed in one deployment step. 
		The order of deployment is important when there are dependencies between the plug-ins. During deployment the plug-ins of all features 
		marked to be deployed are transferred to the server. Then the P2 planner is used to decide whether all mutual plug-in dependencies 
		are fulfilled by the transferred plug-ins in relation to the plug-ins that already running on the server. 
		If not, the deployment is rolled back and an error message referencing the first unfulfilled dependency is displayed.</p>


		<p>Instructions for each of these tasks can be found in this help, see <cite>Swordfish Deployment Tasks.</cite></p>
